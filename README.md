## About This Fork

This extension is forked from commit [4af8583](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph/commit/4af8583a42082b2c230d2c0187d4eaff4b69c665) (May 9, 2019) - the final commit released under the MIT license.

After this point, the original project adopted a custom license that permits use and modification but **prohibits publishing or distributing derivative works**.

`neo-git-graph` aims to:
- Continue the open-source legacy of the original MIT version
- Add modern features and improvements
- Maintain compatibility with current VS Code versions (6+ years of updates)
- Keep the extension fully free and open-source
